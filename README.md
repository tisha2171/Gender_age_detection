## 📌 About This Project

This project was developed as part of a course conducted by **NullClass**.

The original implementation and concept were taught during the class.  
The primary difference in this version is that the entire model was implemented and trained using **Google Colab** instead of a local environment.

All credits for the teaching structure and base implementation go to NullClass.
